## :green_heart: NodeJs:
Node.js is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. Itâ€™s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser.

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.
